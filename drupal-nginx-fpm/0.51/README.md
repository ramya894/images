# Drupal-nginx-php Docker
This is a Drupal Docker image which can run on both 
 - [Azure Web App on Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/app-service-linux-intro)
 - [Drupal on Linux Web App With MySQL](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Drupal.Drupalonlinux )
 - Your Docker engines's host.

You can find it in Docker hub here [https://hub.docker.com/r/appsvcorg/drupal-nginx-fpm/](https://hub.docker.com/r/appsvcorg/drupal-nginx-fpm/)

# Components
This docker image currently contains the following components:
1. Drupal (Git pull as you wish)
2. nginx (1.14.0)
3. PHP (7.2.13)
4. Drush
5. Composer (1.8.0)
6. MariaDB ( 10.1.26/if using Local Database )
7. Phpmyadmin ( 4.8.3/if using Local Database )

## How to Deploy to Azure 
1. Create a Web App for Containers, set Docker container as ```appsvcorg/drupal-nginx-fpm:0.5``` 
   OR: Create a Drupal on Linux Web App With MySQL.
2. Add one App Setting ```WEBSITES_CONTAINER_START_TIME_LIMIT``` = 900
3. Browse your site and wait almost 10 mins, you will see install page of Drupal.
4. Complete Drupal install.

## How to configure GIT Repo and Branch
1. Create a Web App for Containers
2. Add new App Settings

Name | Default Value
---- | -------------
GIT_REPO | https://github.com/azureappserviceoss/drupalcms-composer-azure
GIT_BRANCH | master

4. Browse your site

>Note: GIT directory: /home/drupal_prj.
>Note: root: /home/site/wwwroot -> /home/drupal_prj/web
>Note: ```WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE``` = false, Before restart web app, need to store your changes by "git push", it will be pulled again after restart.
>
>Note: ```WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE``` = true, and /home/site/wwwroot/sites/default/settings.php is exist, it will not pull again after restart.

## How to connect external data resources, e.g., Azure Database for MySQL / Azure Redis Cache / Log Analytics

Connecting other Azure services to your Web App is easy.  The following services are commonly used with Drupal:

  * [Azure Database for MySQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/) - (see [best practices section](#best-practices-for-azure-database-for-mysql) below)
  * [Azure Cache for Redis](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cache/)
  * Azure Monitor [Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/learn/tutorial-viewdata)

To connect an external service:
1. Create the resources in Azure
1. Add credentials/keys in App Settings for your Web App for Containers instance.  E.g., 
    * DATABASE_HOST: [db_host]
    * DATABASE_NAME: [db_name]
    * DATABASE_USERNAME: [db_user]
    * DATABASE_PASSWORD: [db_name]
    * REDIS_HOST: [redis_host]
    * REDIS_PORT: 6379
    * REDIS_PASSWORD: [redis_password]
    * OMSWORKSPACE_ID: [oms_workspace_id]
    * OMSWORKSPACE_PRIMARY_KEY: [oms_workspace_primary_key]
1. These App Settings can be accessed as environment variables from `settings.php` (or elsewhere as needed). For example, DATABASE_NAME can be accessed from within PHP via the `getenv` command, such as in `$mysql_db = getenv('APPSETTINGS_DATABASE_NAME');`.

### Best practices for Azure Database for MySQL
1. Create a Azure Database for MySQL, create a DB ([Reference]( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/)).
1. Check the following settings in the Azure Database for MySQL instance:
    - SSL enforce status: DISABLED
    - Update Connection security, edit Firewall rules, add allow IP list.
1. Add the app settings below to your web app:
    - DATABASE_HOST: [db_host]
    - DATABASE_NAME: [db_name]
    - DATABASE_USERNAME: [db_user]
    - DATABASE_PASSWORD: [db_name]
    - WEBSITES_CONTAINER_START_TIME_LIMIT: 1200
    - WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE: True

Now Drupal should successfully connect to the database instance.

### How to configure to use Local Database with web app 
1. Create a Web App for Containers 
2. Update App Setting ```WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE``` = true
3. Add new App Settings 

Name | Default Value
---- | -------------
DATABASE_TYPE | local
DATABASE_USERNAME | some-string
DATABASE_PASSWORD | some-string

>Note: We create a database "azurelocaldb" when using local mysql. Hence use this name when setting up the app.

4. Browse http://[website]/phpmyadmin

### Using the fluentd plugin for Azure Log Analytics

OMS Log Analytics can be used to conveniently centralize logs across all container instances. This image includes a default configuration for fluentd that will capture the nginx access and error logs.

To use the default configuration, just add the following App Settings to your Web App:

  * OMSWORKSPACE_ID=my_oms_workspace_id
  * OMSWORKSPACE_PRIMARY_KEY=my_oms_workspace_primary_key

When the environment variable `APPSETTING_OMSWORKSPACE_ID` is detected, entrypoint.sh will add the default fluentd configuration to the services managed by supervisord.

# How to turn on Xdebug to profile the app
1. By default Xdebug is turned off as turning it on impacts performance.
2. Connect by SSH.
3. Go to ```/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d```,  Update ```xdebug.ini``` as wish, don't modify the path of below line.
```zend_extension=/usr/local/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20170718/xdebug.so```
4. Save ```xdebug.ini```, Restart php-fpm by below cmd:
```
# find gid of php-fpm
ps aux
# Kill master process of php-fpm
killall -9 php-fpm
# start php-fpm again
php-fpm -D && chmod 777 /run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock
```
5. Xdebug is turned on.

## How to update config files of nginx
1. Go to "/etc/nginx", update config files as your wish. 
2. Reload by below cmd: 
```
/usr/sbin/nginx -s reload
```

## Tips of Log rotate
1. By default, log rotate is disabled if deploy this images to web app for containers of azure. It's enabled if you use this image by "docker run".
2. Log rotate is managed by crond, you can start it with below cmd, it will check logs files in the /home/LogFiles/nginx every minute, and rotate them if bigger than 1M. Old files are stored in /home/LogFiles/olddir, keep 20 backup files by default setting.
```
crond
```
3. Please keep an eye on the log files, the performance will be going down if it's too big.
4. If you don't like to start crond service to triage log rotate every minute, you also can manually triage it by below cmd as your wish, it will talk a while if these log files have already been too big.
```
logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf
```

# Updating Drupal version , themes , files 

If ```WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE``` = false  ( which is the default setting ), we recommend you DO NOT update the Drupal core version, themes or files.

There is a tradeoff between file server stability and file persistence. Choose either one option to updated your files:

##### OPTION 1 : 
Since we are using local storage for better stability for the web app , you will not get file persistence.  In this case , we recommend to follow these steps to update WordPress Core  or a theme or a Plugins version:
1.	Fork the repo https://github.com/azureappserviceoss/drupalcms-composer-azure
2.	Clone your repo locally
3.	Download the latest version of Drupal , plugin or theme being used locally
4.	Commit the latest version bits into local folder of your cloned repo
5.	Push your changes to the your forked repo
6.	Login to Azure portal and select your web app
7.	Click on Application Settings -> App Settings and change GIT_REPO to use your repository from step #1. If you haven't changed the branch name, you can continue to use linuxapservice. If you wish to use a different branch, update GIT_BRANCH setting as well.

##### OPTION 2 :
You can update ```WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE``` = true  to enable app service storage to have file persistence. Note when there are issues with storage  due to networking or when app service platform is being updated, your app can be impacted.
You can use below composer cmds to install theme/modules. 

[More Informatio](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-manage-drupal-site-dependencies):

```
cd /home/drupal-prj
composer require drupal/redis
composer require drupal/adminimal_theme
```
## Limitations
- Must include  App Setting ```WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE``` = true  as soon as you need files to be persisted.
- Deploy to Azure, Pull and run this image need some time, You can include App Setting ```WEBSITES_CONTAINER_START_TIME_LIMIT``` to specify the time in seconds as need, Default is 240 and max is 1800, suggest to set it as 900 when using this version.
