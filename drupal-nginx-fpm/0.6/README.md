This is a Drupal Docker image which can run on both 
 - [Azure Web App on Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/app-service-linux-intro)
 - [Drupal on Linux Web App With MySQL](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Drupal.Drupalonlinux )
 - Your Docker engines's host.

You can find it in Docker hub here [https://hub.docker.com/r/appsvcorg/drupal-nginx-fpm/](https://hub.docker.com/r/appsvcorg/drupal-nginx-fpm/)

   OR: Create a Drupal on Linux Web App With MySQL.
2. Add one App Setting ```WEBSITES_CONTAINER_START_TIME_LIMIT``` = 1200
3. Browse your site and wait almost 10 mins, you will see install page of Drupal.
4. Complete Drupal install.

## How to configure GIT Repo and Branch
1. Create a Web App for Containers
2. Add new App Settings

## How to configure to use Local Database with web app 
1. Create a Web App for Containers 
2. Update App Setting ```WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE``` = true
3. Add new App Settings 

Name | Default Value
---- | -------------
DATABASE_TYPE | local
DATABASE_USERNAME | some-string
DATABASE_PASSWORD | some-string
>Note: We create a database "azurelocaldb" when using local mysql . Hence use this name when setting up the app
>
>Note: Phpmyadmin site is deployed when using local mysql. Please go to 
http://[website]/phpmyadmin, and login with DATABASE_USERNAME and DATABASE_PASSWORD.

4. Browse your site 
5. Complete WordPress install

# How to turn on Xdebug

2. Connect by SSH.
3. Go to ```/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d```,  Update ```xdebug.ini``` as wish, don't modify the path of below line.
```zend_extension=/usr/local/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20180731/xdebug.so```
4. Save ```xdebug.ini```, Restart php-fpm by below cmd:
```

## How to update config files of varinish

## Tips of Log rotate
1. By default, log rotate is disabled if deploy this images to web app for containers of azure. It's enabled if you use this image by "docker run".
2. Log rotate is managed by crond, you can start it with below cmd, it will check logs files in the /home/LogFiles/nginx every minute, and rotate them if bigger than 1M. Old files are stored in /home/LogFiles/olddir, keep 20 backup files by default setting.
```
crond
```
3. Please keep an eye on the log files, the performance will be going down if it's too big.
4. If you don't like to start crond service to triage log rotate every minute, you also can manually triage it by below cmd as your wish, it will talk a while if these log files have already been too big.
```
logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf
```

# Updating Drupal version , themes , files 

If ```WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE``` = false  ( which is the default setting ), we recommend you DO NOT update the Drupal core version, themes or files.

There is a tradeoff between file server stability and file persistence. Choose either one option to updated your files:

##### OPTION 1 : 
Since we are using local storage for better stability for the web app , you will not get file persistence.  In this case , we recommend to follow these steps to update WordPress Core  or a theme or a Plugins version:
1.	Fork the repo https://github.com/azureappserviceoss/drupalcms-composer-azure
2.	Clone your repo locally
3.	Download the latest version of Drupal , plugin or theme being used locally
4.	Commit the latest version bits into local folder of your cloned repo
5.	Push your changes to the your forked repo
6.	Login to Azure portal and select your web app
7.	Click on Application Settings -> App Settings and change GIT_REPO to use your repository from step #1. If you haven't changed the branch name, you can continue to use linuxapservice. If you wish to use a different branch, update GIT_BRANCH setting as well.

##### OPTION 2 :
You can update ```WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE``` = true  to enable app service storage to have file persistence. Note when there are issues with storage  due to networking or when app service platform is being updated, your app can be impacted.
You can use below composer cmds to install theme/modules. 

[More Informatio](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-manage-drupal-site-dependencies):

```
cd /home/drupal-prj
composer require drupal/redis
composer require drupal/adminimal_theme
```
## Limitations
- Must include  App Setting ```WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE``` = true  as soon as you need files to be persisted.
- Deploy to Azure, Pull and run this image need some time, You can include App Setting ```WEBSITES_CONTAINER_START_TIME_LIMIT``` to specify the time in seconds as need, Default is 240 and max is 1800, suggest to set it as 900 when using this version.
